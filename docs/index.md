## My practice


My practice investigates means of inserting crafted control into digital, automated and industrial textile and garment production technologies and systems, and in subverting traditional practices with new processes and materials. 
Crafting surface design interventions and material provocations, my practice confronts chaotic material and making conditions in the decorative space of creative embellishment. 
Rejecting anachronistic ideas around material purity and craft authenticity, my practice seeks to innovate around sustainability by looking to the idiosyncratic complexities of contemporary life.
