# 1. State of the art, project management and documentation

We began the week with an introduction to Textile Academy and its values. 
A core value which emerged from the presentation and subsequent sharing and discussion was that of equality - establishing avenues to question, to understand and to be safe from harm/s (as pertains to environment, wellbeing, security), to share, to create and to belong in a community.
The ability to delineate a safe space within which to share values and information is crucial, thus setting up micro systems ourselves as students is a logical first step. 

Textile Academy and Fab Lab preference the use of Wiki as a means to share information due to its open structure and creative potential. 
Wiki is an online database that provides means to present and link information collaboratively and effectively, in an equitable, secure way. 
To engage with and contribute to a community of makers in the FabLab and Textile Academy networks, it makes sense to use wiki to create and share content. 

In order to create my own wiki page, I initially needed to generate an SSH (secure shell) key. 
SSH is an encryption protocal enabling secure communication across unsecure networks. 
I secured my site by locally generating an SSH key via Terminal, and linking this to GitLab.

## Code Example

Use the three backticks to separate code.

```
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
```
